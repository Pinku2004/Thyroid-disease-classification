## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

---

## 🌐 Web Interface
The project includes a static web interface:
- `predict.html` – Patient data input form with prediction output

The prediction shown in the web interface is a **demo simulation** to represent
how a trained ML model would behave in real deployment.

---

## 🚀 Results
Among the evaluated models, **Random Forest** achieved the best performance
in terms of accuracy and F1-score.
